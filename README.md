# Siobhan's Wacky MvM
This is intended to be a sourcemod version of the modded Mann vs. Machine server that I own. 
Includes HL2 and HL1 NPCs for the custom maps, such as mvm_black_mesa, the background maps and mvm_novaprospekt. This was originally intended to be part of a Sourcemod extension, but I've given up on the gamedata updates, which lead to the creation of this mod.

- Includes Custom MvM Campaigns
- More to be added soon, such as the recently added Left 4 Dead infected classes, Touhou model replacement mode, etc etc
- Enhanced TFBot AI
